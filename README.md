# AIRLINE_DELAY_DASHBOARD
Analyzed airline operational data using Power BI to uncover delay patterns, cancellation impact, and financial losses, enabling insights into cost drivers and passenger impact.
# Flight Delay & Cancellation Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes airline flight delays and cancellations to quantify operational inefficiencies and financial losses. The dashboard highlights delay patterns, cancellation rates, and cost drivers to support data-driven decision making.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze flight delays and cancellations
- Identify costliest airlines and delay reasons
- Measure financial impact per flight and per passenger

## 🧾 Dataset
- Source: Synthetic dataset (1500 flights)
- Attributes include:
  - Flight details
  - Delay metrics
  - Cancellation status
  - Cost and loss components

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- DAX
- Microsoft Excel

## 📊 Key KPIs
- Total Flights
- Average Delay (minutes)
- Cancellation Rate (%)
- Total Loss (INR)
- Average Loss per Flight
- Loss per Passenger

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Approximately **X%** of flights were delayed or cancelled
- Weather and technical issues contributed to the highest losses
- A small percentage of flights accounted for a disproportionate share of losses
- Average loss per passenger increased significantly during cancellations
