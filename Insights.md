# Key Insights – Flight Delay & Cancellation Analysis

1. **Operational Inefficiency**
   Delayed and cancelled flights account for a disproportionate share of total financial loss compared to on-time flights.

2. **Cancellation Impact**
   Although cancellations occur less frequently than delays, they result in significantly higher loss per flight due to passenger compensation and fixed operational costs.

3. **Airline-Level Variance**
   Certain airlines consistently show higher average loss per flight, indicating operational or scheduling inefficiencies.

4. **Delay Reason Analysis**
   Weather and technical issues emerge as the primary contributors to total loss, outweighing crew and ATC-related delays.

5. **Passenger Impact**
   Loss per passenger increases sharply during cancellations, highlighting the direct financial burden of service disruptions.

6. **Cost Structure**
   Fuel and operational costs form the largest base expenses, while delay-related compensation amplifies losses during disruptions.

7. **Flight-Level Concentration**
   A small subset of flights contributes disproportionately to total losses, suggesting opportunities for targeted operational improvements.

8. **Delay vs Loss Relationship**
   Higher delay durations are positively correlated with increased financial loss, emphasizing the cost sensitivity of schedule deviations.

9. **Operational Reliability**
   Airlines with higher on-time performance demonstrate significantly lower average loss per flight.

10. **Business Implication**
    Improving predictive maintenance, weather readiness, and schedule buffers can materially reduce cancellation-driven losses.
